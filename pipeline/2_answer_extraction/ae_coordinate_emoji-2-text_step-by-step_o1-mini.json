It's a lightweight object that can float.\n\n2. **Fork**: A utensil used for eating, or a tool used in gardening and other activities. It has practical, everyday applications.\n\n3. **Lock**: A device used to secure doors, containers, or information (in the case of digital locks). It's essential for security purposes.\n\n4. **Chart Down**: This term is less common and could be interpreted in a few ways:\n   - **Chart Down** as a phrase might imply a downward trend in a graph or chart.\n   - It could be a typographical error or misphrasing for something like \"chart town\" or \"chat down,\" but without additional context, its meaning remains unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity of \"chart down,\" and the clear, practical applications of the other options, **lock** stands out as a versatile and essential tool widely used in various contexts for security.\n\n**Answer:** lock\n</response>\n\nWhich answer was given to the question?
