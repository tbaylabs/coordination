# Non-Reasoning Models Summary CSV Documentation

## File Structure
This CSV file contains summary statistics for various non-reasoning model experiments, with 108 rows and 14 columns.

## Filtering Categories

### Task Set
The data can be filtered by task set, with three possible values:
- "all"
- "symbol"
- "text"

Note: When viewing the data, it's recommended to display only one task set at a time for clarity.

### Include Unanswered
This field is stored as a string (not a boolean) with two possible values:
- "True"
- "False"

### Condition
There are three experimental conditions:
- "control"
- "coordinate"
- "coordinate-COT"

### Models
The dataset includes results from six different models:
- "llama-31-405b"
- "llama-31-70b"
- "claude-35-sonnet"
- "llama-33-70b"
- "gpt-4o"
- "deepseek-v3"

## Metrics Columns
The dataset includes several statistical metrics:

1. Top Proportion Metrics:
   - top_prop: Float
   - top_prop_sem: Float (Standard Error of Mean)
   - top_prop_ci_lower_95: Float (95% Confidence Interval Lower Bound)

2. Absolute Difference Metrics:
   - absolute_diff: Float
   - absolute_diff_sem: Float
   - absolute_diff_ci_lower_95: Float

3. Percent Difference Metrics:
   - percent_diff: Float
   - percent_diff_sem: Float
   - percent_diff_ci_lower_95: Float

4. Statistical Significance:
   - p_value: Float

## Data Handling Notes
1. When filtering the data, it's recommended to show results for one task set at a time to avoid confusion.
2. The unanswered_included field is stored as a string ("True"/"False") rather than a boolean value, so string comparison should be used for filtering.
3. All numeric columns are stored as floating-point numbers and should be handled accordingly.
